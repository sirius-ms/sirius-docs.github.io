We do our best so that you will not be confronted with errors while
using SIRIUS. But we cannot test every possible scenario. We encourage
you to submit a bug report to us via GitHub ([sirius-ms/sirius](https://github.com/sirius-ms/sirius/issues/new/choose)) 
in case you encounter an error.  


You can also use the bug report feature within the SIRIUS GUI to e.g. automatically provide
log files.
In that case it is very helpful if you specify your email address. 
Often, errors are very specific and can only be reproduced and understood with help of the
input file and knowledge of the used parameter settings. Therefore, we
might reach out to you. With your help, we will continue to improve
SIRIUS.

You can also check our [SIRIUS Community space on Gitter](https://matrix.to/#/#sirius-ms:gitter.im) to connect with other users and get help from the community.
