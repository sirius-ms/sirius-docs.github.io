## Activating a SIRIUS License for MassHunter Explorer Users

Users with a valid [Agilent MassHunter (MH) Explorer license]({{"/integrations/#MassHunter-Explorer" | relative_url }}) are eligible for a specialized SIRIUS license at no additional cost. This license supports up to three user accounts organized into a "Group". **The SIRIUS user account used to initialize the group becomes its permanent "Manager".** This individual is responsible for administration and occupies one of the three available seats.

**Key Constraints:**
* All group members must use email addresses from the same organizational domain.
* Once a user is added to a group, they cannot be removed or replaced.
* Initial activation must be performed on a Windows machine where MassHunter Explorer is installed and licensed.

**The following steps should only be performed by the designated manager of your group.**

* **Step 1: Install SIRIUS:** <br>
  Ensure MH Explorer is installed and activated on your local machine. Download and install the [newest version of SIRIUS](https://github.com/sirius-ms/sirius/releases) (6.3 or higher).
* **Step 2: Register the Group Manager:** <br> Launch the SIRIUS GUI. [Sign in to your SIRIUS account.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh7wqGDXPA&t=27s) [If you do not have one, complete the registration process first.]({{"/account-and-license/#account-creation" | relative_url }}) Click the ``Register Explorer`` button.

  SIRIUS will verify your local MH Explorer license and automatically open the SIRIUS User Portal in your web browser.
* **Step 3: Create the SIRIUS License Group:** <br>
  Log in to the SIRIUS User Portal with your SIRIUS account.<br>

* **Step 4: Add Users to the Group:** <br>
  In the User Portal, navigate to ``Manage Groups`` in the left sidebar. Locate your group and click the ``Users`` icon <img src="{{ "/assets/images/manage-users-button.png" | relative_url }}" alt="BG user portal login" width="50"> on the right. Enter the email address of the colleague you wish to add. Before they can be added, the colleague must have already registered a SIRIUS account using an email address with the same domain as the Manager. Click ``ADD``. Once added, a user account cannot be removed from your SIRIUS license.

* **Step 5: Deployment:**<br>
  Once the activation and member assignment are complete, the three authorized users may log in to SIRIUS on any workstation (Windows, macOS, or Linux). A local installation of MH Explorer is no longer required for subsequent use.

**Replacing users:** If a user is leaving the group or company, we can replace them with a new person upon request.
