With SIRIUS 6 we moved away from the file based project space to a Nitrite database.
This was necessary to improve performance and enable new features. CLI, API and GUI store the computed results as SIRIUS project-space, 
which in turn can also be an input for the GUI or the CLI.
This allows the user to review results in the GUI that have been computed with an automated workflow using the CLI or API.

## Input

SIRIUS supports MS data in several formats: `.ms`, `.mgf` and Agilent's `.cef` contain already processed peak lists for each feature. 
For `.mzml` and `.mzxml` feature detection and alignment will be performed by SIRIUS. However, all data must be centroided.

### Peak list-based formats

##### MGF-Format

SIRIUS also supports the MGF (Mascot Generic Format). This file format
was developed for peptide spectra for the mascot search engine. Each
spectrum in a MGF file can contain many spectra each starting with and
ending with . Peaks are again written as pairs of m/z and intensity
values separated by whitespaces with one peak per line. Further meta
information can be given as NAME=VALUE pairs. SIRIUS recognizes the
following meta information:

  - PEPMASS: contains the measured mass of the ion (e.g. the parent
    peak)

  - CHARGE: contains the charge of the ion. As SIRIUS supports only
    single charged ions, this value can be either 1+ or 1-.

  - MSLEVEL: should be 1 for MS spectra and 2 for MS/MS spectra. SIRIUS
    will treat higher values automatically as MS/MS spectra, although,
    it might be that it supports MSn spectra in future versions.

This is an example for a MGF file:

```
BEGIN IONS 
PEPMASS=438.32382 
CHARGE=1+ 
MSLEVEL=2 
185.041199 4034.674316
203.052597 12382.624023 245.063171 50792.085938 275.073975 124088.046875
305.084106 441539.125 335.094238 4754.061035 347.09494 13674.210938
365.105103 55487.472656 
END IONS
```
See also the GNPS database for other examples of MGF files.

##### SIRIUS MS-Format

A disadvantage of these data formats is that
they do not contain all information necessary for SIRIUS to perform the
computation. Missing meta information have to be provided via the
commandline. Therefore, SIRIUS supports also an own file format very
similar to the MGF format above. The file ending of this format is `.ms`.
Each file contains one measured feature (but arbitrary many spectra).
Each line may contain a peak (given as m/z and intensity separated by a
whitespace), meta information (starting with the **\>** symbol followed
by the information type, a whitespace and the value) or comments
(starting with the **\#** symbol). The following fields are recognized
by SIRIUS:

TODO: Is feature/compound already changed here?

  - \>compound: The name of the measured feature (or any placeholder).
    This field is **mandatory**.

  - \>parentmass: the mass of the parent peak

  - \>formula: The molecular formula of the feature. This information
    is helpful if you already know the correct molecular formula and
    just want to compute a fragmentation tree or recalibrate the
    spectrum

  - \>ion: the ionization mode. See for the format of ion modes.

  - \>charge: is redundant if you already provided the ion mode.
    Otherwise, it gives the charge of the ion (1 or -1).

  - \>ms1: All peaks after this line are interpreted as MS peaks

  - \>ms2: All peaks after this line are interpreted as MS/MS peaks

  - \>collision: The same as \>ms2 with the difference that you can
    provide a collision energy

An example for a .ms file:
```
>compound Gentiobiose
>formula C12H22O11 
>ionization \[M+Na\]+ 
>parentmass 365.10544

>ms1 
365.10543 85.63 366.10887 11.69 367.11041 2.67

>collision 20 
185.041199 4034.674316 
203.052597 12382.624023 
245.063171 50792.085938 
275.073975 124088.046875 
305.084106 441539.125 
335.094238 4754.061035 
347.09494 13674.210938 
365.105103 55487.472656
```
Note: The `.ms` file format is SIRIUS' internal format and might change with as same speed as the SIRIUS
developend went forward. Nevertheless we try to provide backward compatibilty where possible.
A more detailed and commented but also WIP example of the an `.ms` file can be found [here](ms-file.md)   


### LCMS-Runs

SIRIUS can import full LCMS-Runs in (`.mzML`/`.mzXML`) format via the
prepossessing tool. In the GUI this is done implicitely when importing the data. In the CLI you can also run the [LC-align]({{ "/cli/#lcms-align-feature-detection-and-feature-alignment-preprocessing" | relative_url }}) subtool.

## Output

### SIRIUS project-space

In SIRIUS 6, the project space is stored in a singular .sirius file that is no longer human or machine-readable.
This step was necessary to ensure performance for many of the new features and is in no way intended to "close off" results.
Summaries can be written as usual using the GUI or CLI. Advanced information or intermediate results (e.g. predicted
fingerprints) can be accessed using the new API.


### Summary files

The summaries written by CLI or GUI are in *tsv* (tab-separated-values) format and named "formula_identifications.tsv",
"canopus_formula_summary.tsv", "canopus_structure_summary.tsv", "structure_identifications.tsv", "denovo_structure_identifications.tsv" and "spectral_matches.tsv".
They provide easy access to the results for further downstream analysis, data
sharing and data visualization. The summaries are not imported into
SIRIUS but are (re-)created based on the actual results every time a
project-space is exported. Summaries are created for molecular formula annotation, compound class prediction, structure annotation and spectral library matches separately.
 
#### Important columns

The unique key `alignedFeatureId` is used to link results to a feature (aligned over multiple runs).
If available, the `mappingFeatureId` provides an external id (e.g. if "FEATURE_ID" was specified in the .mgf) or else the `alignedFeatureId`.  
Additionally, `ionMass` and `retentionTimeInSeconds` are provided.

#### Molecular formula results summary

`formula_identifications.tsv` contains the top-ranked formula result of each feature as 
determined by the SIRIUS score, or the ZODIAC if available.
However, different adduct candidates with the same precursor ion molecular formula
will have identical score (e.g. `[C20H14O6 + NH4]+` and `[C20H19NO7 - H2O + H]+`).
In such cases, the top-ranked candidate is decided by the adduct ranking (see [Adduct sorting]({{ "/advanced-background-information/#adduct-sorting" | relative_url }})).
This summary additionally contains all scores shown in the GUI as well as potential lipid class annotations.  


#### Molecular structure results summary

`structure_identifications.tsv` contains the top-ranked structure result of each feature 
as determined using the CSI:FingerID score; the molecular formula of the top structure
does not have to be the top-ranked molecular formula of this feature. The formula rank shows the
original rank of the molecular formula belonging to the top hit.

The summary contains confidence scores for exact and approximate mode, CSI:FingerID, ZODIAC and SIRIUS scores.
Links to structure databases containing the structure hit can be found in the "links" column. 


#### CANOPUS results summary

CANOPUS results are specific to a molecular formula. Since the top molecular formula annotated in the molecular
formula annotation sub tool can potentially differ from the molecular formula of the top structure hit, both are reported separately.

`canopus_formula_summary.tsv` contains compound classes predicted to be present by CANOPUS for
the top-ranked molecular formula of each feature. *most specific class* denotes the most specific compound class for this feature. The columns
*level 5*, *subclass*, *class*, and *superclass* refer to the ancestors of this most specific class.

`canopus_structure_summary.tsv` contains compound classes predicted to be present by CANOPUS for
the molecular formula belonging to the top-ranked structure of each feature. *most specific class* denotes the most specific compound class for this feature. The columns
*level 5*, *subclass*, *class*, and *superclass* refer to the ancestors of this most specific class.


If there are multiple molecular formulas with same score but different adducts (but the same precursor molecular formula) then candidates are sorted by the [Adduct sorting]({{ "/advanced-background-information/#adduct-sorting" | relative_url }}).


#### Spectral matches summary

`spectral_matches.tsv` contains spectral library matches for all features. 


### Standardized project-space summary with mzTab-M

The project-space is a SIRIUS-specific format that allows the user to
access all results and analysis details, but may not be optimal for
sharing this data with third party tools or data archives. For this
purpose, SIRIUS provides an analysis report (`analysis_report.mztab`) in
the standardized mzTab-M format. All results summarized in this report
are linked to the results in the corresponding SIRIUS project-space,
allowing the user to share summarized results using mzTab-M without
losing the connection to the detailed results provided in the
project-space. Furthermore, SIRIUS passes meta information (if available in the input) 
such as scan numbers and ids of the input data into this analysis report. This allows
for an easy combination of the SIRIUS results with the results of other
analyses such as MS1-based quantification.

### Parameter formats

#### Ion modes

Whenever SIRIUS requires the ion mode, it should be given in the
following format:

```
[M+ADDUCT]+ for positive ions
[M+ADDUCT]- for negative ions
[M-ADDUCT]+/[M-ADDUCT]- for losses 
[M]+/[M]- for instrinsically charged compounds
[M+?]+ for positive ions with unknown adduct
[M+?]- for negative ions with unknown adduct
```

*ADDUCT* is the molecular formula of the adduct. The most common
ionization modes are `[M+H]+, [M+Na]+,[M-H]-, [M+Cl]-`. 
Currently, SIRIUS supports only single-charged compounds, so `[M+2H]2+` 
is not valid and will be skipped during import. Further dimers are also not yet
supported so that everything containing `[2M]` will be skipped during import.

#### Molecular formulas

Molecular Formulas in SIRIUS must not contain brackets. Hence, `2(C2H2)` is not a
valid molecular formula; write `C4H4` instead. Furthermore, all molecular
formulas in SIRIUS are always neutral, and there is no possibility to
add a charge on a molecular formula (instead, charges are given
separately). Hence, `CH3+` is not a valid molecular formula. Write `CH3` instead, and
provide the charge separately via commandline option.

#### Chemical alphabets

Whenever SIRIUS requires the chemical alphabet, you have to provide
which elements should be considered and what is the maximum amount for
each element. Chemical alphabets are written like molecular formulas.
The maximum amount of an element is written in square brackets behind
the element. If no square brackets are given, the element might occur
arbitrary often. The standard alphabet is
CHNOP\[5\]S, allowing the elements C, H, N O and S as well as up to five times the element P.
