You can integrate our libraries into your Java project either by using Maven 
or by directly including the jar files. 
However, we strongly recommend using Maven, 
as our libraries have dependencies on external libraries that are managed automatically by Maven. 
For detailed developer guidance, please refer to our
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/sirius-ms).
