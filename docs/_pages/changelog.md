- feature: improved progress information for background computations.
- feature: new scheduling of remote jobs that reduces computation time and improves local cpu utilization.
- **feature: A Beta version of the new SIRIUS background service is now included in the respective build (_service_ suffix).**
- feature: support for MS1 only data in GUI (Isotope Pattern analysis only).
  - MS1 only data from Agilent CEF format can now be imported

#### 5.5.2
- fix: Collsion energy parsing bug
- feature: Update checker 

#### 5.4.1
- **breaking**: User Authentication. A user account and license is now needed to user the online features of SIRIUS. 
The license is free and automatically available for non-commercial use, details [here]({{ "/install/#creating-a-user-account-since-v410" | relative_url }}). 
- **breaking**: New [project-space]({{ "/io/#output" | relative_url }}) compression. Method level directories are now compressed archives to reduce number of files and save storage. 
- **breaking**: Summary writing has been moved to a separate sub-tool (`write-summaries`). Som summary files have slightly changed. Usually just additional columns if at all.
- **breaking**: The `fingerid`/`structure` sub-tool has been split into a  `fingerprint` (fingerprint prediction)
and a `structure` (structure db search) sub-tool. This allows the user to recompute the database search 
without having to recompute the fingerprint and compound class predictions. It further allows to compute `canopus`
compound class prediction without having to perform structure db search.
- **breaking**: Updated Fingerprint vector. Fingerprint related results of SIRIUS 4 projects might have to be recomputed 
to perform some modification (e.g. recompute db-search). Reading the projects is still possible and formula results do not affected.  
- **breaking**: Custom database format has changed. Custom databases need to be re-imported

- feature: **Tool** - **El Gordo** lipid class annotation. 
- feature: **GUI Tool** - **Epimetheus** sub-structure annotation. Combinatorial fragmentation of CSI:FingerID candidates to assign fragment peaks to sub-structures of the candidate.
- feature: **GUI View** - New feature rich **spectrum viewer**. Mirror-plot to compare Isotope pattern and Simulated isotope pattern (e.g. ). 
- feature: **GUI View** - **LC-MS** view to review chromatographic peak and data quality report for a given feature/compound
- feature: CANOPUS now fully supports **NPC** classes (prediction, GUI and output)
- feature: **GUI** advanced filtering options
- feature: **GUI** scaling factor can be defined by the user (setting panel)
